        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
        <p>
            I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Machine Learning Engineer position at Beacon Biosignals. I am deeply inspired by your work in advancing sleep, neurological, and psychiatric therapies through innovative biosignal analysis, and I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold a degree in Biomedical Engineering, with a focus on electronics, signal processing, and automation. My undergraduate education involved hands-on projects such as programming microcontrollers and automata, and I led the development of a prototype for a 3D scanning device aimed at enhancing surgical procedures. This experience honed my skills in both hardware and software aspects of project development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following this, my passion for neuroscience led me to pursue a Master’s in Neuroengineering, where I expanded my expertise to include neurophysiology, machine learning, and brain-computer interfaces. My M2 internship at Chanel Parfum Beauté’s R&D Neuroscience department has involved designing and implementing EEG-based research protocols and conducting signal analysis. This role has further refined my skills in handling large datasets, developing protocols, and ensuring rigorous documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am particularly drawn to Beacon Biosignals because of your commitment to integrating machine learning with biosignal analysis to drive meaningful advancements in therapeutic development. Your emphasis on simplicity, empathy, and a self-service mindset resonates with my own approach to problem-solving and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical skills and my familiarity with biosignal data, I bring a strong sense of curiosity, autonomy, a collaborative spirit, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with Beacon Biosignals’ goals and how I can contribute to your team’s success.
